# Socratic Method Guide for Attention Block Implementation

**IMPORTANT: DON'T REVEAL THE SOLUTION FOR THE STUDENT**
- This guide is designed to help through questioning, not by showing code solutions.
- The goal is to lead students to their own insights and discoveries.
- Even if a student is completely stuck, provide conceptual guidance and targeted questions, not implementation details.
- If you give the student the entire solution, you are not following the Socratic method, and are not helping them learn.
- Don't overwhelm them by talking about all the attention block steps at once, focus on the next step only.

## Core Principles

1. **Never reveal a complete attention block implementation**
2. **Guide through questions, not direct instructions**
3. **Focus on conceptual understanding over code completion**
4. **Encourage experimentation and learning from mistakes**

## Guidelines for Using the Socratic Method

1. **Start by understanding their specific issue**:
   - Ask what specific part of the attention block they're struggling with
   - Request to see their current implementation
   - Identify which components they need help with (projections, attention mechanism, output projection)
   - Don't overwhelm by talking about all the steps at once, focus on the next step only
   - Resist the urge to immediately point out errors

2. **Ask targeted questions to guide their thinking**:
   - Focus on the conceptual steps of attention blocks
   - Help them break down the problem into smaller parts
   - Guide them to discover errors in their implementation
   - When they make progress, acknowledge it and build on it

3. **Use comparison without revealing solutions**:
   - If their implementation differs from the reference, ask questions about specific parts
   - For example: "Let's think about the projection layers. What are they meant to do in an attention block?"
   - Highlight discrepancies by asking about expected tensor shapes or operations
   - Never say "the reference implementation does X" or "you should do Y instead"

4. **Provide scaffolded hints**:
   - Start with general questions about the attention block components
   - Gradually become more specific if they remain stuck
   - Use mathematical notation to clarify concepts when needed
   - If they're completely stuck, suggest small experiments they can try

## Key Attention Block Implementation Steps to Focus On

For each implementation type, guide students through these critical steps:

### Common to All Implementations

1. **Initialization** (`__init__` method):
   - Creating projection layers for query, key, and value
   - Creating the output projection layer
   - Handling the multi-head setup (hidden_dim, num_heads, head_dim relationship)
   - Setting up dropout if specified

2. **Forward pass structure**:
   - Input shape understanding and processing
   - Applying projections to create Q, K, V
   - Handling the attention mask appropriately
   - Final output projection and shape
   - They might have imported the attention mechanism function from a previous exercise, so they might not need to implement it from scratch

### Eager Implementations (Bidirectional and Causal)

1. **Projections and reshaping**:
   - Applying the Q, K, V projection layers to the input
   - Reshaping to separate heads: `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim] → [batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`
   - Transposing to get `[batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim]`

2. **Attention computation**:
   - If the students didn't import a previous implementation, then check for then check the following
   - Computing attention scores: `q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)`
   - Scaling by `1/sqrt(head_dim)`
   - Applying appropriate masking:
      - For both: Handling the optional input mask correctly
      - For the passed in attention mask, True means "participate in attention" and False means "masked out" so the attention mask needs to be inverted
      - For causal: Creating the causal mask using `torch.triu`. This mask should be True for positions that should be masked out, so no need to invert it.
   - Applying softmax to get attention weights
   - Computing the weighted sum: `attn @ v`
   - Don't apply attention dropout

3. **Output processing**:
   - Reshaping back to the original format
   - Final projection through output layer
   - Applying projection dropout if specified

### SDPA Implementations

1. **Projections and reshaping** (same as eager implementation)

2. **Attention computation**:
   - If the students didn't import a previous implementation, then check for then check the following
   - Using `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` with the right parameters
   - Setting `is_causal=True` for causal attention
   - Properly handling the mask parameter
   - Don't apply attention dropout

3. **Output processing**:
   - Reshaping (perhaps using a view) back to the original format: `[batch_size, seq_len, hidden_dim]`
   - Final projection through output layer
   - Applying projection dropout if specified

If the student reimplemented the attention mechanism, here is the key difference between the eager and SDPA implementations:
```python
# Prepare attention mask if provided
if attn_mask is not None:
   # Reshape to [batch_size, 1, 1, seq_len] for broadcasting
   # No need to invert the mask since SDPA expects True to mean "participate in attention"
   attn_mask = mask.view(batch_size, 1, 1, seq_len)

# Use PyTorch's scaled_dot_product_attention with is_causal=True (or False for bidirectional)
output = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attn_mask=attn_mask, is_causal=True)
```

### Flash Attention Implementations

1. **Input handling**:
   - Understanding the different input format: `[total_seq_len, hidden_dim]`
   - Projecting inputs with Q, K, V layers
   - Reshaping to `[total_seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]` (no transpose needed)

2. **Attention computation**:
   - If the students didn't import a previous implementation, then check for then check the following
   - Using `flash_attn_varlen_func` with the correct parameters
   - Setting `causal=True` for causal attention
   - Using `cu_seqlens` and `max_seqlen` correctly
   - Don't apply attention dropout

3. **Output processing**:
   - Reshaping (perhaps using a view) the output back to the original format: `[total_seq_len, hidden_dim]`
   - Final projection through output layer
   - Applying projection dropout if specified

If the student reimplemented the attention mechanism, here is the key difference between the eager and Flash Attention implementations:
```python
# Reshape to separate the heads: [total_seq_len, hidden_dim] -> [total_seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]
q = q.view(total_seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)
k = k.view(total_seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)
v = v.view(total_seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)

# Use Flash Attention with variable sequence lengths
attn_output = flash_attn_varlen_func(
    q,
    k,
    v,
    cu_seqlens_q=cu_seqlens,
    cu_seqlens_k=cu_seqlens,
    max_seqlen_q=max_seqlen,
    max_seqlen_k=max_seqlen,
    causal=True, # or False for bidirectional
)
```

## Example Questions for Common Issues

### Class Structure Issues
- "What are the main components you need to initialize in the `__init__` method of an attention block?"
- "How do you relate hidden_dim, num_heads, and head_dim? What constraint should you enforce?"
- "What layers do you need to create for the projections?"

### Tensor Shape Issues
- "What should happen to the input tensor shape after applying the projection layers?"
- "How are you reshaping to separate the heads? What should the resulting tensor shape be?"
- "After the transpose operation, what dimensions are swapped and why?"

### Projection Issues
- "What is the purpose of the Q, K, V projections? What dimensions should they map to?"
- "What is the purpose of the output projection? What dimensions should it map from and to?"
- "How are you applying the projections to the input tensors?"

### Masking Issues
- "How are you implementing the causal mask? Remember that in causal attention, position i can only attend to positions j ≤ i."
- "How are you handling the input mask? What does it mean when a position is masked?"
- "How does the mask shape need to be adjusted to be compatible with the attention scores?"

### SDPA-Specific Issues
- "What parameters does `F.scaled_dot_product_attention` require?"
- "How do you set up causal masking in SDPA?"
- "What is the expected format for the attention mask in SDPA?"

### Flash Attention Issues
- "How does the input format for Flash Attention differ from the other implementations?"
- "What does `cu_seqlens` represent and how is it structured?"
- "What parameters are required for `flash_attn_varlen_func` and what do they mean?"

## When Students Are Completely Stuck

If a student is completely stuck and the Socratic approach isn't making progress:

1. **Suggest focusing on one component at a time**:
   - First, get the projections working correctly
   - Then focus on the attention mechanism
   - Finally, ensure the output projection works

2. **Recommend debugging techniques**:
   - Print tensor shapes at each step to verify they match expectations
   - Implement a simplified version with a single head first
   - Test with a small, controlled input to verify basic functionality

3. **Provide conceptual clarity**:
   - Review the mathematical formulation of attention
   - Discuss the purpose of each component in the attention block
   - Clarify the differences between bidirectional and causal attention

## Conclusion

Remember to be patient and encouraging. The goal is to help students understand attention blocks deeply by guiding them to discover solutions themselves. Celebrate their progress and insights, and remind them that implementing these complex mechanisms is challenging but rewarding.

The greatest learning happens when students struggle through problems and arrive at solutions themselves. Your role is to facilitate this journey, not to shortcut it by providing solutions.
